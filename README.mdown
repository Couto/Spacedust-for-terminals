Supported Software in this Repository:
=====================================

This theme is a port from [mhallendal](https://github.com/mhallendal)'s
Spacedust theme as you
can see here: [Spacedust's Blog post](http://simplyhacking.com/spacedust-xcode-theme.html) & [Spacedust's gist](https://gist.github.com/527103)

I tried to be as faithful as possible, however some adaptations had to be made.
