Spacedust for iTerm2
====================

This theme is a port from [mhallendal]("github.com/mhallendal")'s
Spacedust theme as you
can see here: [Spacedust's Blog post](http://simplyhacking.com/spacedust-xcode-theme.html) & [Spacedust's gist](https://gist.github.com/527103)

I tried to be as faithful as possible, however some adaptations had to be made.

They obviously go to [mhallendal]("github.com/mhallendal") since he's the original creator of this theme.
