Spacedust Theme
====================

Supported Software in this Repository:
=====================================
 * [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/)
 * [MacOSX's Terminal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/all.html#terminal)

This theme is a port from [mhallendal](https://github.com/mhallendal)'s
Spacedust theme as you
can see here: [Spacedust's Blog post](http://simplyhacking.com/spacedust-xcode-theme.html) & [Spacedust's gist](https://gist.github.com/527103)

I tried to be as faithful as possible, however some adaptations had to be made.
